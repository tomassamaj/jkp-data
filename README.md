# Global Factor, Stock, and Firm data

This repo contains Python code to generate the global dataset of factor returns, stock returns, and firm characteristics from [“Is there a Replication Crisis in Finance?”](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.13249) by Jensen, Kelly, and Pedersen (Journal of Finance, 2023).

## Data Usage

This package requires a valid [WRDS](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/) subscription. The authors do not distribute WRDS, CRSP, Compustat, or IBES data; this tool only orchestrates the user's own licensed downloads and transformations. Outputs generated locally are derived from your licensed WRDS data and remain subject to your WRDS and vendor license terms.

If you do not have a WRDS subscription, you can still access pre-computed factor portfolios at [jkpfactors.com](https://jkpfactors.com) and pre-computed stock returns and firm characteristics at the [WRDS Global Factor Data page](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/get-data/contributed-data-forms/global-factor-data/).

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Obtain your WRDS credentials.
- Ensure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer) installed on your system.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repo**

   - Clone the folder to your local machine by running the following command from your terminal:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/bkelly-lab/jkp-data.git
     ```
2. **Input WRDS credentials**

   - To save your WRDS credentials, navigate to the `jkp-data/` folder and run:
     ```sh
     jkp connect
     ```
     Kindly follow the prompts.

     Note: If you need to change your password or credentials, run `jkp connect --reset` and then `jkp connect`

3. **Run the script**

   - We run the code via a Slurm scheduler, but we also show how to run it in an interactive Python session.

   - Before running the following commands, make sure you are in `jkp-data/`

   - On a cluster with a Slurm scheduler, run:
     ```sh
     sbatch slurm/submit_job_som_hpc.slurm
     ```
     to create the factor returns, stock returns, and firm characteristics.

     In an interactive session, run:
     ```sh
     jkp build data/
     ```
     to create the stock returns and firm characteristics, and
     ```sh
     jkp portfolio data/
     ```
     to create the factor returns.

   **IMPORTANT:** When starting the code, you may be prompted to grant access to WRDS using two-factor authentication, for example via a Duo notification. You need to approve this request, as the program will otherwise fail. After a few seconds or minutes, you should see data being created in the output directory. If that is not the case, please check your internet connection or credentials.

When the code is finished, you can find the output in the `processed/` subdirectory of your output directory (e.g. `data/processed/`).
Please see the release notes (`documentation/release_notes.html`) for a description of the output files and a comparison between the output of the SAS/R codebase and the new Python codebase.

## Notes
- By default, output files are written in Parquet format. To output CSV files instead (with quoted strings to preserve leading zeros in identifiers like `gvkey`), run:
  ```sh
  jkp portfolio data/ --output-format csv
  ```

- By default, the end date for the data in the code is 2025-12-31, which you can change by editing the `end_date` assignment in `src/jkp/data/config.py`. For example, for May 6, 1992, use: `END_DATE = date(1992, 5, 6)`.

- **Persistent WRDS Connection**: If you're running on an HPC cluster with NAT IP rotation (such as Yale's Bouchet cluster), you may receive many MFA prompts during data download. This happens because each database query creates a new TCP connection, and the NAT gateway assigns a random outbound IP to each connection. WRDS sees these as connections from different locations and triggers MFA for each.

  To avoid this, use the `--persistent-connection` flag, which maintains a single database connection throughout the download process:
  ```sh
  # Interactive session
  jkp build data/ --persistent-connection

  # Slurm job (set environment variable)
  sbatch --export=ALL,PERSISTENT_WRDS_CONNECTION=1 slurm/submit_job_som_hpc.slurm
  ```
  This reduces MFA prompts from ~26 (one per table) to just 1 (at connection time).

- To run the code, we utilize a high performance computing cluster, where we request 450 GB RAM and 128 CPU cores. Running the routine takes about 6 hours.

- To understand the data, please refer to our [documentation](https://jkpfactors.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Documentation.pdf).

- We distribute the global factor returns generated from this codebase at [jkpfactors.com](https://jkpfactors.com) and the stock returns and firm characteristics at [wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/get-data/contributed-data-forms/global-factor-data/](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/get-data/contributed-data-forms/global-factor-data/).

- The original SAS/R codebase is still available at [github.com/bkelly-lab/ReplicationCrisis](https://github.com/bkelly-lab/ReplicationCrisis), but we recommend using this new Python codebase for future work.
