# Global Factor, Stock, and Firm data

This repo contains Python code to generate the global dataset of factor returns, stock returns, and firm characteristics from ["Is there a Replication Crisis in Finance?"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.13249) by Jensen, Kelly, and Pedersen (Journal of Finance, 2023).

## Data Usage

This package requires a valid [WRDS](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/) subscription. The authors do not distribute WRDS, CRSP, Compustat, or IBES data; this tool only orchestrates the user's own licensed downloads and transformations. Outputs generated locally are derived from your licensed WRDS data and remain subject to your WRDS and vendor license terms.

If you do not have a WRDS subscription, you can still access pre-computed factor portfolios at [jkpfactors.com](https://jkpfactors.com) and pre-computed stock returns and firm characteristics at the [WRDS Global Factor Data page](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/get-data/contributed-data-forms/global-factor-data/).

## Prerequisites

- Active [WRDS](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/) account with access to CRSP and Compustat.
- Python 3.11 or later.

## Installation

Install with your preferred Python package manager:

**pip**
```bash
pip install jkp-data
```

**conda / mamba**
```bash
pip install jkp-data
```
(Run inside your active conda environment.)

**uv**
```bash
uv add jkp-data
```

> **uv tip:** Activate the virtual environment (`source <venv-path>/bin/activate`) and run `jkp` commands directly — no need to prefix every command with `uv run`. Tab completion also works when the environment is activated.

After installation, the `jkp` command is available from any directory.

## Setup: WRDS credentials

Run the following command once to save your WRDS credentials:

```bash
jkp connect
```

Follow the prompts. To update your credentials later, run `jkp connect --reset`.

## Running the pipeline

The full pipeline requires approximately 450 GB of RAM and 128 CPU cores, which for most users means running on a high-performance computing cluster. Interactive use on a workstation is possible for testing, but the full global dataset will exceed the memory available on most desktop machines.

**Build stock returns and firm characteristics:**

```bash
jkp build <output-dir>
```

**Build factor returns** (run after `jkp build`):

```bash
jkp portfolio <output-dir>
```

`<output-dir>` is any directory of your choice (e.g. `~/data/jkp`). Final output is written to `<output-dir>/processed/`.

**Note:** When the pipeline first connects to WRDS, you may receive a two-factor authentication prompt (e.g. a Duo push notification). Approve it promptly — the pipeline will stall until you do.

### Running on a Slurm cluster

Most HPC clusters use Slurm. Below is a template job script — adapt the partition, account, and environment activation to match your cluster:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=jkpfactors
#SBATCH --partition=<your-partition>
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=128
#SBATCH --mem=450G
#SBATCH --time=15:00:00
#SBATCH --output=%x_%j.out
#SBATCH --error=%x_%j.err
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL

# Fail fast: stop the job on the first error so `jkp portfolio` doesn't run if `jkp build` fails
set -eo pipefail

# Make threaded libraries respect the Slurm CPU allocation
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK}
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK}
export NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK}

# Activate your environment so that jkp is on PATH
source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate

# Set PERSISTENT_WRDS_CONNECTION=1 to use a single WRDS connection (reduces MFA on NAT-rotated networks)
if [ "${PERSISTENT_WRDS_CONNECTION:-0}" = "1" ]; then
    jkp build ~/data/jkp --persistent-connection
else
    jkp build ~/data/jkp
fi

jkp portfolio ~/data/jkp
```

Submit with:

```bash
sbatch jkp_job.slurm
```

## Notes

- **Output format:** Files default to Parquet. To write CSV instead (with quoted strings to preserve leading zeros in identifiers like `gvkey`), pass `--output-format csv`:

  ```bash
  jkp portfolio <output-dir> --output-format csv
  ```

- **End date:** The default end date is 2025-12-31. Support for overriding this without editing source is planned for a future release.

- **Persistent WRDS connection:** On HPC clusters with NAT IP rotation, each database query may trigger a separate MFA prompt because the outbound IP changes between connections. Pass `--persistent-connection` to maintain a single connection throughout the download, reducing approximately 26 prompts to one. The Slurm template above supports this via the `PERSISTENT_WRDS_CONNECTION` environment variable.

- **Documentation:** See our [documentation](https://jkpfactors.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Documentation.pdf) for a full description of output files and a comparison with the original SAS/R codebase.

- **Pre-built data:** Factor returns are available at [jkpfactors.com](https://jkpfactors.com). Stock returns and firm characteristics are available through [WRDS](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/get-data/contributed-data-forms/global-factor-data/).

- **Original codebase:** The original SAS/R codebase is available at [github.com/bkelly-lab/ReplicationCrisis](https://github.com/bkelly-lab/ReplicationCrisis), but we recommend this Python codebase for future work.
